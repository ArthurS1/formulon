# Scripts

This folder contains a collection of POSIX compliant shell scripts and JSON files. They are tools to help you test the API.

Make sure you setup the **ENDPOINT** environment variable and have [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) installed before using them.

```sh
export ENDPOINT=localhost:8080
```
